# Accessibility Standards 

## Description

For this assignment I was tasked with refactoring an existing site to make it more accesible. In order to make the site more accesible several steps were taken, such as adding alt attributes to images, ensuring the code contained semantic HTML elements, and contained a concise, descriptive title. These actions not only make the site more accesible for everyone, they also optimize the site for search engines.  




## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.


## License

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).
